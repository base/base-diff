## Usage

**Heads up!** This isn't quite ready for use. It's close but needs to be documented and cleaned up first! 

[verb][] is used in this example, but the plugin can be registered with any application that uses [base-methods][].

```js
var diff = require('{%= name %}');
var verb = require('verb'); 
var app = verb();
app.use(diff());
```

### gulp usage

```js
var diff = require('base-diff');
var through = require('through2');
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('diff', function () {
  return gulp.src('*.txt')
    .pipe(diff.file('diffChars'))
    .pipe(somePlugin())
    .pipe(diff.file()) // automatically shows the diff
    .pipe(gulp.dest('.'));
});
```
