# base-diff [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/base-diff.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/base-diff) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/doowb/base-diff.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/doowb/base-diff)

> Plugin for adding a diff method to a 'base' application.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i base-diff --save
```

## Usage

**Heads up!** This isn't quite ready for use. It's close but needs to be documented and cleaned up first!

[verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb) is used in this example, but the plugin can be registered with any application that uses [base-methods](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/base-methods).

```js
var diff = require('base-diff');
var verb = require('verb'); 
var app = verb();
app.use(diff());
```

### gulp usage

```js
var diff = require('base-diff');
var through = require('through2');
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('diff', function () {
  return gulp.src('*.txt')
    .pipe(diff.file('diffChars'))
    .pipe(somePlugin())
    .pipe(diff.file()) // automatically shows the diff
    .pipe(gulp.dest('.'));
});
```
